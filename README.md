[![Deploy documentation](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-task/actions/workflows/docs.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-task/actions/workflows/docs.yaml) [![Ruff](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-task/actions/workflows/ruff.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-task/actions/workflows/ruff.yaml) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A curated catalog of standard cognitive and behavioral neuroscience tasks and the cognitive processes they engage, developed as part of the [HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors)](https://www.hedtags.org/) standardization effort. Its purpose is to provide a controlled vocabulary for tagging datasets with what their participants were asked to do, so that repositories can be searched by task or by process and datasets can be compared across laboratories.

The Catalog currently covers **103 tasks** in **18 paradigm families**, **172 cognitive processes** in **19 categories**, and **486 task-process links**. Each task has a canonical definition, an inclusion test, named variations, verified references and a mapping to the Cognitive Atlas. The Catalog is a work in progress; suggestions, corrections and proposals are welcome as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-task/issues).

The Catalog is published as a searchable website at **<https://www.hedtags.org/hed-task/>**.

## Repository structure

```
hed-task/
|-- src/                    # Documentation generators (Python)
|   |-- generate_docs.py    # Entry point: validates data/ and regenerates docs/source/
|   |-- build_atlas_data.py # Recomputes data/atlas_summary.json from the Atlas harvest
|   |-- build_atlas_maps.py # Refreshes data/mappings/*.tsv, preserving curation
|   |-- fetch_cog_data.py   # Rebuilds the Atlas API archive in .cog_data/
|   |-- generators/         # One module per page family
|-- data/                   # The Catalog: task/process JSON, schemas, Atlas mappings, task families
|-- docs/
|   |-- source/             # Sphinx source: hand-written narrative pages plus generated catalog pages
|   |-- _build/             # Build output (gitignored)
|-- tests/                  # Unit tests
|-- pyproject.toml
```

Two kinds of page live in `docs/source/`. The narrative pages (landing page, introduction, how to use, the four Cognitive Atlas pages, and the three Methods documents) are hand-written Markdown: edit them directly. The catalog pages (`tasks/`, `processes/`, `task_process_links.md`, and the table fragments in `_generated/`) are generated from the JSON and TSV data in `data/` by the scripts in `src/`, and are never edited by hand. Each hand-written page says so in a comment at its top. See [Regenerating the site](#regenerating-the-site) below.

The Catalog itself lives in `data/`: `task_details.json`, `process_details.json`, their JSON Schemas, the Cognitive Atlas mapping tables and the paradigm-family tables. It is edited here by pull request; `data/README.md` says how, and `python src/generate_docs.py` validates every edit before writing a page. The two JSON files began as a one-time import from the research workspace that found the citations (`src/import_catalog.py` records that migration).

## Local development

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 or later.

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-task.git
cd hed-task
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate (Linux / macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

### Regenerating the site

Whenever `data/` changes, run both steps. Editing a narrative page needs only step 2.

**Step 1 - regenerate the Markdown source:**

```bash
python src/generate_docs.py
```

This validates `data/task_details.json` and `data/process_details.json` against their schemas and against each other, then deletes the generated paths under `docs/source/` (`tasks/`, `processes/`, `task_process_links.md`, `_generated/`), and rewrites them. It never touches a narrative page. It refuses to run, naming the record, if any check fails: unknown process or category ids, a process whose `tasks` list disagrees with the tasks that name it, a reference role outside the vocabulary, a variation without its derived id, or a task without a family. CI runs the same generation and fails a pull request whose pages are out of date.

`atlas_summary.json` and `mappings/*.tsv` are derived from a byte-exact archive of the [Cognitive Atlas](https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/) REST API kept in `.cog_data/`, which is untracked. Only the derived files are committed, so the docs build never needs the archive. To refresh, run:

```bash
python src/fetch_cog_data.py      # rebuild .cog_data/ from the Atlas API (resumable)
python src/build_atlas_data.py    # recompute data/atlas_summary.json
python src/build_atlas_maps.py    # refresh the mapping tables, preserving curation
```

`build_atlas_data.py` and `build_atlas_maps.py` both take `--archive` if the archive is not at `.cog_data/`.

**Step 2 - build the HTML:**

```bash
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/_build/html
```

Then open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a browser to preview. A clean build emits no warnings.

Narrative pages can use a few live counts from the data, written as `{{ n_tasks }}`, `{{ n_processes }}`, `{{ n_categories }}`, `{{ n_families }}`, `{{ n_variations }}`, `{{ n_links }}` or `{{ n_linked }}`; `docs/source/conf.py` defines them at build time. A table that follows the data is pulled in from `docs/source/_generated/` with an include directive.

Do not run `mdformat` over `docs/source/`. It rewrites the generated MyST directives into a form Sphinx cannot parse. The `mdformat` CI check is scoped to the hand-written Markdown at the repository root for that reason:

```bash
python -m mdformat --check --wrap no --number *.md
```

### Run tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

### Lint and format

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
```
