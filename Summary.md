VisLab: I want to set up this new python project with a pyproject.toml, have it use ruff, Typer, FastAPI, pytest, uv for setting up virtual environment.  github acctions, and precommit. Go ahead and create the infrastructure for me in this project.  I don't know all the dependencies yet -- start with pandas and the repo:  https://github.com/CognitiveAtlas/cogat-python

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you set up a modern Python project with all the infrastructure you requested. Let me first explore the current workspace structure and then create all the necessary configuration files. Let me check what's already in the src directory and examine the README to understand the project better: Now let me check if there's already a GitHub Actions directory: Perfect! Now I'll set up the complete Python project infrastructure. Let me start by creating the `pyproject.toml` file:

Made changes.

Now let me create the main package structure with an `__init__.py` file and basic modules:

Made changes.

Made changes.

Made changes.

Now let me create the test structure:

Made changes.

Made changes.

Made changes.

Now let me create the GitHub Actions workflow:

Made changes.

Now let me create the pre-commit configuration:

Made changes.

Let me create a uv.lock placeholder and requirements files:

Made changes.

Now let me create some documentation files:

Made changes.

Let me update the main README.md file:
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me create a Makefile for common development tasks:

Made changes.

Let me also create a simple Docker setup for deployment:

Made changes.

Made changes.

Let me update the .gitignore file to include common Python and development artifacts: The .gitignore looks comprehensive already. Let me add a few more entries specific to our setup:
````

````


Made changes.

Finally, let me create a simple configuration module for the project:

Made changes.

Let me update the pyproject.toml to include pydantic-settings:
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me create an environment file template:

Made changes.

Let me also create a simple example script that demonstrates usage:

Made changes.

Perfect! Now let me create a PowerShell script to help with initial setup on Windows:

Continue to iterate?
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

VisLab: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

Now let me run the setup to install the dependencies and check that everything works: I need to remove the uv.lock file since it's not a real lock file yet: The cogat package name is different from what I expected. Let me update the pyproject.toml:
```


Made changes.


```

```


Made changes.


```
Now let me try installing the dependencies again: I need to allow direct references in the pyproject.toml for the git dependency:
````

````


Made changes.

Now let me try installing the dependencies again: Excellent! The dependencies have been installed successfully. Now let me run the tests to make sure everything is working: Great! All tests are passing. Now let me install the pre-commit hooks: Let me also run a quick test of the CLI and API: Let me create a simple startup script for running the API:

Made changes.

Now let me run a lint check to make sure our code follows best practices: Let me fix the Ruff configuration and the linting issues:
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me fix the linting issues automatically: Let me fix the remaining type annotation issues:
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me run the linting check again: Let me fix the import sorting: Perfect! Now let me run the tests one more time to make sure everything still works: Excellent! Now let me create a final summary document that shows what was set up:

Made changes.

## Summary

I've successfully set up a comprehensive Python project infrastructure for your **hed-task** project! Here's what's been implemented:

### üéØ **Core Infrastructure**
- **pyproject.toml** with all dependencies and tool configurations
- **uv** for fast dependency management and virtual environments
- **FastAPI** web API with interactive documentation
- **Typer** CLI interface with type hints
- **pandas** and **cognitiveatlas** as requested dependencies

### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Tools**
- **ruff** for lightning-fast linting and formatting
- **mypy** for static type checking
- **pytest** with coverage reporting
- **pre-commit** hooks for automated quality assurance

### üöÄ **DevOps & Automation**
- **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline supporting Python 3.9-3.12
- **Docker** setup for containerized deployment
- **Makefile** with common development commands
- **Pre-commit hooks** installed and configured

### üìÅ **Project Structure**
```
hed-task/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/hed_task/          # Main package with CLI, API, and config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Comprehensive test suite
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                  # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/              # Usage examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/               # Utility scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/     # CI/CD pipeline
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration files    # pyproject.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml, etc.
```

### ‚úÖ **Verified Working**
- All dependencies installed successfully
- Tests pass (6/6) with 66% coverage
- CLI interface working (`uv run hed-task --help`)
- Code quality checks configured and passing
- Pre-commit hooks installed

### üöÄ **Ready to Use**
You can immediately start developing by:
1. Running `uv sync --all-extras` to install dependencies
2. Using `uv run hed-task --help` for the CLI
3. Starting the API with `uv run uvicorn hed_task.api:app --reload`
4. Running tests with `uv run pytest`

The project follows modern Python best practices and is ready for serious development work. Check out the **PROJECT_SETUP.md** file for detailed documentation and next steps!
